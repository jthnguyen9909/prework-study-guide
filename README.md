# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a Prework Study Guide website that is functional in that I can easily find and read structured information about the four topics I learned.
My motivation was to create a basic foundation and understanding of fundamental concepts of web development.
I built this project as a way to learn and test my knowledge of web development, as well as familiarize myself with a developer mindset.
I learned the various uses of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and their roles in creating code as well as the importance of debugging and deconstructing code.
